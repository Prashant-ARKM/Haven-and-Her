## **About**

Haven-and-Her is a lightweight women’s health companion web platform focused on menstrual health awareness, understanding body changes, and providing supportive guidance across different life stages — from teenage years to adulthood and menopause. It aims to normalize conversations about menstrual health and help users recognize meaningful symptoms before issues escalate. ([GitHub][1])

## **Problem Statement**

Many people struggle to understand changes in menstrual health and often dismiss symptoms as “stress” or “normal.” Haven-and-Her provides clear, empathetic guidance so users can spot meaningful changes, learn what they mean, and act appropriately rather than feeling alone or confused.
